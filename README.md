## Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rifatsh3ikh/PyRoll-Program.git
    cd PyRoll-Program
    ```

2.  **Install the required dependency:**
    ```bash
    pip install customtkinter
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4.  Click the "Roll Dice" button to see the result.
